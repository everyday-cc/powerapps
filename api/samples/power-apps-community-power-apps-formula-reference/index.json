Use it if you are looking for a one stop shop for all Power Apps formulas to use as a reference. Or simply share it with someone who is getting started on this beautiful journey! It provides an interactive illustration for each formula. As a result, users not only see the syntax, but also enter their own data and see what the formula does! So enter text/numbers, pick a date, or choose a value from a dropdown and see the magic unfold!</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"toc-hId--788440361\"><strong>Story</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This all started with a Lunch &amp; Learn session at Hitachi Solutions. It was an introductory session where we introduced formulas and showed a couple of examples! As a result, I thought about how awesome it would be to have that experience for all formulas. That realization, in turn, resulted in the creation of this app! This was a fun project. However, the biggest challenge was to to come up with working/interactive examples for each formula without adding any datasource.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"toc-hId-954369974\"><strong>Features</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>150+ interactive illustrations covering (almost) all Power Apps formulas</li>\r\n<li>Instructions to guide users through the illustrations</li>\r\n<li>Search through the list using formula name or keywords</li>\r\n<li>Self contained data and no external data sources</li>\r\n<li>Videos for formulas that require a datasource for illustration</li>\r\n<li>Supports both online and offline usage</li>\r\n<li>A simple illustration of offline capabilities</li>\r\n<li>Links to official Microsoft Docs pages for detailed explanations</li>\r\n<li>Provide feedback (better illustration ideas, corrections etc.) with one click</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 id=\"toc-hId--1597786987\"><strong>What this is not</strong></h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This supplements<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/formula-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Docs</a>, not replace them. Therefore, use the docs for detailed explanations of each formula</li>\r\n<li>This does not illustrate how formulas can be used with each other to solve more complex problems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To summarize, if you want to have fun with Power Apps formulas, go ahead and download this app!</p>\r\n\r\n","type":"download","topics":["Power Apps"]}
