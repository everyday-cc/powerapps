It can also be used to convert between RGB and hex colors. There are some helpful links to some Web Content Accessibility Guidelines sections that are of note for color-related considerations as well as a link to the WebAIM website which served as the inspiration for some of the app design.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The general design idea was to have a useful, self-contained phone app and not have to switch back and forth between web pages when choosing colors.&nbsp;It also has a light/dark mode and it will remember the last colors you entered (but not if using on the web). There is also some basic error messaging to help if a color code is entered out of range or with information missing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To use, simply choose a type of color to enter (RGB or hex) for the foreground and/or background, enter the value, and select 'Set Color'. The app will do the math on the color contrast ratio and give a pass/fail assessment for WCAG AA and AAA ratings on normal and large text as well as WCAG AA for graphical objects and UI components.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hope this is helpful!</p>\r\n\r\n","type":"download","topics":["Power Apps"]}
