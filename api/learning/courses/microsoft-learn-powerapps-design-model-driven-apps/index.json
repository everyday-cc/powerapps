These components include dashboards, forms, views, and charts. With no code, or very little, you can make apps that are simple or very complex. Unlike in canvas app development, where the designer has total control over the app layout, much of the layout in model-driven apps is determined by the components you add. In other words, the emphasis is more on quickly viewing your business data and making decisions than on intricate app design.","sourceUrl":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/powerapps/api/learning/courses/microsoft-learn-powerapps-design-model-driven-apps/index.json","webUrl":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-model-driven-apps-in-powerapps/","originalUrl":null,"featuredContent":null,"actions":null,"length":"PT1H14M","ratings":{"count":2973,"average":4.548604},"provider":{"name":"Microsoft Learn","domain":"microsoft.com","images":[{"url":"https://everyday-cc.github.io/powerapps/assets/images/organizations/microsoft.com-50x50.jpg","width":50,"height":50,"title":null,"attribution":null,"isCached":false}],"publishers":null,"authors":null},"publishedDateTime":null,"levels":["Beginner"],"topItems":null,"size":null,"heat":51,"tags":null,"images":null,"content":"\r\n","type":"course","price":"Free","topics":["Power Apps","Model-driven apps"]}
