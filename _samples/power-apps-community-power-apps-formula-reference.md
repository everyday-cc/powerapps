<h2 id="toc-hId-1763716600"><strong>Announcing the Power Apps Formula Reference!</strong></h2>
<p>I am very excited to announce the release of an app that I have been working on for a few months now! Use it if you are looking for a one stop shop for all Power Apps formulas to use as a reference. Or simply share it with someone who is getting started on this beautiful journey! It provides an interactive illustration for each formula. As a result, users not only see the syntax, but also enter their own data and see what the formula does! So enter text/numbers, pick a date, or choose a value from a dropdown and see the magic unfold!</p>
<h2 id="toc-hId--788440361"><strong>Story</strong></h2>
<p>This all started with a Lunch &amp; Learn session at Hitachi Solutions. It was an introductory session where we introduced formulas and showed a couple of examples! As a result, I thought about how awesome it would be to have that experience for all formulas. That realization, in turn, resulted in the creation of this app! This was a fun project. However, the biggest challenge was to to come up with working/interactive examples for each formula without adding any datasource.</p>
<h2 id="toc-hId-954369974"><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>150+ interactive illustrations covering (almost) all Power Apps formulas</li>
<li>Instructions to guide users through the illustrations</li>
<li>Search through the list using formula name or keywords</li>
<li>Self contained data and no external data sources</li>
<li>Videos for formulas that require a datasource for illustration</li>
<li>Supports both online and offline usage</li>
<li>A simple illustration of offline capabilities</li>
<li>Links to official Microsoft Docs pages for detailed explanations</li>
<li>Provide feedback (better illustration ideas, corrections etc.) with one click</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc-hId--1597786987"><strong>What this is not</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This supplements<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/formula-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Docs</a>, not replace them. Therefore, use the docs for detailed explanations of each formula</li>
<li>This does not illustrate how formulas can be used with each other to solve more complex problems</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, if you want to have fun with Power Apps formulas, go ahead and download this app!</p>
