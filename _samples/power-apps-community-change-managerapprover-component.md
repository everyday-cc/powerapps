<p>My customers are always wanting the ability whenever i build an app that has something that requires approval to be able to change the approver. i.e. holiday request goes to the users manager but what if the manager is off sick? HR need a way to change the manager, or maybe the person should be selecting who their approver is, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, here is a change manager component. It includes inputs for changing the front and back colours and outputs of the original manager and the new manager (as a record, the entire Office 365 record for that person) and also a text output of the reason why they changed from old to new.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to add in the Office365Users Data Source for it to work.</p>
