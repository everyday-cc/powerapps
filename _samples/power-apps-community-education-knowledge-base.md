<p>Thank you to Alice Keeler (@alicekeeler) for sharing a list of resources collected at Chawanakee Academy.</p>
<p>This app was made as a personal design challenge to view and search content in a spreadsheet more easily. Run with it and try applying its principles to another spreadsheet you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario: you want employees to contribute to a knowledge base with links to resources that would be helpful to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot (430).png" style="width: 999px;"><img src="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/54775iB8A52C8614909F8A/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999" title="Screenshot (430).png" alt="Screenshot (430).png" li-image-url="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/54775iB8A52C8614909F8A?v=1.0" li-image-display-id="'54775iB8A52C8614909F8A'" li-message-uid="'245412'" li-messages-message-image="true" li-bindable="" class="lia-media-image" tabindex="0" li-bypass-lightbox-when-linked="true" li-use-hover-links="false"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setup</p>
<ol>
<li>From the ribbon, click View &gt; Datasources</li>
<li>Click the ellipsis and remove the existing tables. This is so you can add your own connection to a spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Click + Add Datasource</li>
<li>If you have not already connected Google Sheets as a connection to PowerApps, click + Add Connection, otherwise skip steps 4-5.</li>
<li>(Continuing from + Add Connection) Select Google Sheets. You'll be prompted to sign into Google Sheets and asked to allow permissions.</li>
<li>Once Google Sheets is a connection, select it from the list of available datasources.</li>
<li>You'll see a list of all spreadsheets available on your Google Drive. Browse for the 'Resources for Chawanakee Academy (Responses)'.</li>
<li>You'll see a list of all the workbooks from the spreadsheet. Select 'Form Responses 1'.</li>
<li>Remove this screen when you're done setting up.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The app in its current form is set to communicate with a spreadsheet called 'Form Responses 1' and its columns.</p>
<p>If you decide you want to use this same app for another spreadsheet, you will need to tinker with all instances that reference 'Form Responses 1' and any of its columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can break the connection to 'Form Responses 1' and use the App Checker to see what you need to repair (see the stethoscope icon at the top right corner). It will pull up a pane that shows each location that needs to be fixed.</p>
