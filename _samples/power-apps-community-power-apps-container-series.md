<p>This is a continuation of my Power Apps Container series. In this video we are going to build a responsive home screen.</p><p>The overall design is broken down into three layers.</p><ol><li><span>The primary or main layer is set to responsive design.</span></li><li><span>The secondary layer references the primary.</span></li><li><span>The tertiary layer references the secondary.</span></li></ol><p>Using this layer technique, controls such as buttons and labels in each container automatically becomes responsive. Attached is the MSAPP file which is the demo app I showed at the begging of the video.<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="videoUrl hidden">watch?v=2h70ZmVaGyw</span></p>
