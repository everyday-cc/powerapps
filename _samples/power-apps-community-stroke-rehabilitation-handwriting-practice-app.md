<p>I survived a Stroke in June of 2017. Having recently taken part in Rory Neary's ( @AzureRory ) from Zero to Hero Power Apps course I wanted to try to create a simple app that Stroke Survivors (or anyone undergoing rehab) could use to practice their eye/hand coordination.</p><p>The app allows the user to trace the image selected using the pen input screen.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://apps.powerapps.com/play/318a9e05-26e5-45ea-b187-fe159f9e591d?tenantId=d67b401f-110c-498d-9359-36b1e8fb3ae7" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://apps.powerapps.com/play/318a9e05-26e5-45ea-b187-fe159f9e591d?tenantId=d67b401f-110c-498d-935...</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first time I have uploaded anything to the community, I hope I have done this correctly and hope you all like the app!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
