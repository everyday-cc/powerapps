<p>This demo is a proof of concept/template for adding an app store to a Power App as well as a simple SharePoint-based file viewer with dynamic icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But why an app store?" you ask? Several years ago when I first embarked on the digital initiative for the company I work for, I was doing the initial roll-out of computers and new digital forms for our supervisor staff. This training was completely derailed due to my lack of preparation into how basic I would need to go and how wide the knowledge gap truly was. Some of them had zero experience with a computer at all! Needless to say, this changed the way I think about what 'ease of use' really is and what components need to be added to for a diverse user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This app is a direct result of that lesson. When rolling out a company-wide employee portal app, which would include access to a variety of documents among other information, I realized that many of our employees probably don't have much experience with Office applications like Word or Excel and, as such, likely don't have them on their phones. Because of the diverse geography of our work crews and difficulty in scheduling trainings for all of them at once, I decided the best solution was two parts: first, having icons for the documents to easily identify their type and, second, to have a way for them to obtain the apps for those documents easily and within the app. This demo contains both of those parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In closing, I hope that this is of some use to the Power Apps community and that my gaffs can help your users have a wonderful experience, regardless of their technological experience level!
