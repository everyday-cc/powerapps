<p>A simple canvas app that allows users to order food at their office canteen on their mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It has substantial business value as this is often overlooked and not given much thought in many companies. Having a simple way for employees to order their lunch is a guaranteed way to get your colleagues to like you&nbsp;<img class="lia-deferred-image lia-image-emoji" src="/html/emoticons/1f601.png" alt=":beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:" title=":beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing fancy in this app. What I made was two custom entities in CDS, one for the menus and one for the actual food orders. No rules have been applied or logic. It's not really required as you can simply disable the old menus when you add new ones. This way the users can't choose an old menu using the entity lookup field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instructions on the install:</p><p><img class="lia-deferred-image lia-image-emoji" src="/html/emoticons/1f449.png" alt=":backhand_index_pointing_right:" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:">import this solution <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xwe5x7zjfooefsi/CanteenApp_1_0_0_1.zip?dl=0" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">file</a>&nbsp;(dropbox link).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Installing the attached CanteenApp.msapp won't work as the custom CDS entities are not included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
